# Triggered Alerts

This page provides a detailed logging of alerts, which criteria and conditions had been satisfied by the readings made by the sensors, resulting to alerts being triggered. It also shows the details of what specific alerts had been triggered and the sensor readings that caused them. Aside from that, this view offers the functionality to resolve alerts, so they would no longer be shown from the dashboard view. Below are the details of this page.

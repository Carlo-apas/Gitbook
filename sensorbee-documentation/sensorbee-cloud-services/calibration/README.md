# Calibration

Calibration plays a vital role in maintaining the precision and trustworthiness of instruments used to measure gas concentrations. The gas calibration procedure involves validating the instrument's output against established reference values from calibration standards or stations. By fine-tuning the calibration settings, the device can be optimized to deliver highly accurate gas measurements, which is essential for upholding the robustness and reliability of gas monitoring operations.

The calibration system offered within the Sensorbee Cloud Portal takes a thorough approach by performing both baseline calibration to establish a reference point, and span calibration across a range of values. This dual methodology helps ensure comprehensive calibration of the instruments.

To make sure a gas sensor is accurate, it needs to be calibrated. This is done by testing it with two different gas levels:

1. A low level, usually with no gas at all
2. A high level, with a lot of the gas

The sensor readings at the low and high levels are used to adjust the calibration. This helps the sensor give correct measurements, both when there is very little gas and when there are higher amounts. Doing both low and high calibration points makes the sensor more reliable overall.

> Note: The calibration feature is only available for accounts with the Sensorbee Cloud Analytics Package.

To perform calibration using the Sensorbee Cloud Portal, follow these steps:

1. [Calibrate](https://www.notion.so/Baseline-and-Span-Calibration-6e97042ff979475fa5dd992bdd6d355e?pvs=21): Follow the instructions to identify the appropriate time periods for minimum and maximum reference gas concentrations and adjust the calibration parameters accordingly.
2. [R² Correlation](https://www.notion.so/R-Correlation-91e9f2fa793f46559e265f14f6a8376c?pvs=21): Assess the correlation between the sensor's measurements and the reference data to evaluate the effectiveness of the calibration process.
3. [Upload Reference Data](https://www.notion.so/Upload-Reference-Data-107c3a4d253e4fc7beb915069320ca1d?pvs=21): Provide the necessary reference data to facilitate accurate calibration of the gas sensors.

By following this comprehensive calibration procedure, you can ensure that your gas measurement instruments provide accurate and reliable data, enabling effective gas monitoring and analysis.

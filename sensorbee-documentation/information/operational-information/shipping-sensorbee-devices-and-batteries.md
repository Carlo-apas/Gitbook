Some partners may want to ship devices with batteries and SIM cards inserted before providing these to their customers. This reduces the chance of end users mishandling or not provisioning the devices correctly. It can help to ensure devices will be working when they are received - rather than relying on the correct process being followed.This article guide covers the general guidelines on shipping provisioned devices.

* Shipments must be appropriately labeled.

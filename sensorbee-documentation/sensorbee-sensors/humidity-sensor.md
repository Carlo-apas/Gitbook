# Humidity Sensor



***

A humidity sensor quantifies the water vapor concentration in the air, typically expressed as a percentage of maximum potential humidity.

In the Sensorbee Pro series, encompassing the Air Pro and Modbus Pro, the humidity sensor is located within the front-end module (**SB3516**). Utilizing a capacitive sensing mechanism, this sensor guarantees precise and dependable readings, regardless of environmental fluctuations.

For comprehensive sensor specifications and performance metrics, kindly consult the [SB3516 datasheet](https://www.notion.so/Datasheets-fd72e01b8f664506a6c6943291b0e92b?pvs=21).

In the Sensorbee Lite series, which includes the Air Lite and Modbus Lite, the humidity sensor is housed directly within a connected sensor dome, known as the [SB3380](https://www.notion.so/Parts-of-Sensorbee-Air-Lite-376698053607496d8e131c8c4abc31e4?pvs=21). The humidity sensor employs a capacitive sensing element, ensuring high precision and reliable measurements across varying environmental conditions.

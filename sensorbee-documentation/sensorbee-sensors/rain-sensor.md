# Rain Sensor

## Rain Sensor

***

The Sensorbee Rain Sensor (**SB3631**) is a top-tier instrument tailored for precise and reliable rain and precipitation measurements. Utilizing a distinguished tipping bucket mechanism, it consistently measures rainfall intensity and accumulated precipitation.

* **Tipping Bucket Mechanism**: Delivers pinpoint accuracy in gauging rainfall intensity.
* **Robust Design**: Built for longevity, it's adept at withstanding various environmental conditions.

The rain sensor seamlessly integrates with our Sensorbee Pro series, connecting effortlessly through the external sensor port. Enhanced with features like leaf guards, bird deterrent spikes, and a built-in spirit level, the sensor ensures straightforward and accurate installation.

For detailed sensor specifications and performance data, please refer to the [SB3631 datasheet](https://www.notion.so/Datasheets-fd72e01b8f664506a6c6943291b0e92b?pvs=21).

Please note that this sensor is not compatible with the Sensorbee Lite series.

## Installation

Before setting up the rain gauge, it's crucial to remove the rubber band securing the tipping bucket. This band ensures the bucket remains free from mechanical stress during transportation.

1. Detach the bottom of the rain gauge to access its internals.
2. Utilize pliers or scissors to safely remove or snip the rubber band.

By following these steps, you ensure the rain gauge operates efficiently upon installation.

When mounting the rain sensor onto a pole or elevated location, it's crucial to ensure its proper positioning. The integrated spirit level aids in achieving a level alignment, which is essential for the accurate operation of the tipping bucket mechanism. Furthermore, it's imperative to place the rain sensor in a location free from obstructions like trees or buildings. Any obstruction can impact the accuracy of rain measurements, so always choose a clear, elevated spot for installation.

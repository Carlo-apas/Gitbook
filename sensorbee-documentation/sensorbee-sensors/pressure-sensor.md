# Pressure Sensor



***

The pressure sensor gauges the ambient atmospheric pressure around it.

In the Sensorbee Pro series, encompassing both the Air Pro and Modbus Pro, the pressure sensor is situated within the front-end module (**SB3516**). Utilizing cutting-edge MEMS technology, the sensor accurately captures pressure readings, making it well-suited for diverse atmospheric monitoring tasks.

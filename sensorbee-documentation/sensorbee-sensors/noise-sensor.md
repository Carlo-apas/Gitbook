# Noise Sensor

***

The noise sensor measures the ambient sound level of its surroundings.

In the Sensorbee Pro series, encompassing both the Air Pro and Modbus Pro, the noise sensor is located within the front-end module (**SB3516**). This sensor utilizes an analog microphone that's sampled by the front-end module microcontroller, delivering measurements in a weighted dBA level.

For detailed sensor specifications and performance data, please refer to the [SB3516 datasheet](https://www.notion.so/Datasheets-fd72e01b8f664506a6c6943291b0e92b?pvs=21).

In the Sensorbee Lite series, encompassing both the Air Lite and Modbus Lite, the noise sensor is integrated directly into a connected sensor dome called the [SB3380](https://www.notion.so/Parts-of-Sensorbee-Air-Lite-376698053607496d8e131c8c4abc31e4?pvs=21). This sensor utilizes a digital microphone that provides measurements in a weighted dBA level.

# Disposal Instructions

**Instructions**\
● The batteries in Sensorbee’s devices should be removed and separated from other\
waste. Sensorbee’s devices uses Lithium-ion batteries.\
● Damaged batteries: handle with care and treat as hazardous.\
● Sort items before return: separate devices, loose batteries, and other accessories such\
as cables from each other.\
● Remove simcards so that no one else can use the unit after disposal.

\
**Swedish customers**\
● Municipal recycling centre (ÅVC): If you are in Sweden, many ÅVC locations accept\
electronic equipment and batteries from businesses. Rules and possible fees can vary,\
so always check with your local municipality before delivering items.\
● Sensorbee is connected to El-kretsen, an authorized producer responsibility organization\
in Sweden. This ensures that we take our producer responsibilities regarding electronic\
equipment and batteries.

\

● Use your authorized national WEEE/battery collection scheme or your organization’s\
contracted waste provider for WEEE and batteries.

\
**Packaging material**\
● Cardboard boxes and paper: flatten and place in paper/cardboard recycling.\
● Plastics: collect separately and place in plastic recycling.

● Protective materials (foam, padding, etc.): check local recycling rules.\
● Sensorbee is connected to Näringslivets producentansvar (NPA). This ensures that we\
take our producer responsibilities regarding packaging materials in Sweden.

\
**What not to do**\
● Do not place devices, batteries, or other electronic accessories in general waste.\
● Do not crush, puncture, or open batteries.



**Why proper waste handling matters**

\
When electronic products and batteries are handled correctly, several important things happen:\
\
● Environmental protection: Hazardous substances are safely removed, preventing soil\
and water pollution.\
● Resource conservation: Materials like copper, aluminum, rare earth elements and\
plastics can be recovered and reused, reducing the need for new raw materials.\
● Safe treatment: When devices and batteries are returned, authorized recycling\
companies make sure hazardous substances are safely removed and valuable raw\
materials are recovered.\
● Legal compliance: There are strict laws in the EU, Sweden, and many other countries\
that require electrical equipment and batteries to be collected and treated separately\
from general waste. These laws make sure that hazardous substances are handled\
safely and that producers like Sensorbee support nationwide take-back and recycling\
systems.

\
By following these instructions, you are helping us meet our legal responsibilities while also\
protecting the environment.

# Terminal Emulator

***

A terminal emulator or serial monitor is required for configuring the Sensorbee Modbus base unit via its USB-C interface. In the absence of a pre-existing terminal emulator, it is necessary to download, install, and configure one. Numerous free alternatives are available for Modbus device configuration, including:

* [Tera Term (Windows)](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en)
* [CoolTerm (Windows, Mac, Linux)](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/)

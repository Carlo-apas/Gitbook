# Reset Menu

***

The base unit's reset menu performs two essential functions:

* It can be used to reset the device's configured data, which is helpful in cases where the device has been misconfigured or is experiencing issues due to incorrect settings.
* The reset menu can also be used to reboot the device, which is necessary for troubleshooting.

ðŸ“” Currently, the base unit only supports the reboot, but additional reset options will be added in future releases.
